Generate a structured workout program based on the user's parameters: goal (fitness objective) = "WEIGHT_LOSS", availableDaysPerWeek (number of workout days per week) = 3, and fitnessLevel (beginner, intermediate, advanced) = beginner. Use only the following exercises, each paired with its target muscle group: [['Squat', 'Legs'], ['Bench Press', 'Chest'], ['Deadlift', 'Back'], ['Pull-Up', 'Back'], ['Shoulder Press', 'Shoulders'], ['Bicep Curl', 'Arms'], ['Tricep Dips', 'Arms'], ['Lunges', 'Legs'], ['Plank', 'Core'], ['Leg Raise', 'Core']]. The output must be a Map<Long, Day>, where the key is the day number (1-7) and the value is a list of exercises in the correct order for that day. Respond only with this collection and nothing else.
